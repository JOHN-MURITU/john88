- Rent Lease Creation: MRE simplifies the process of creating rent leases. It offers customizable templates that enable landlords to generate lease tailored to their specific requirements.

- Rent Payment Tracking: MRE provides a comprehensive system for tracking rent payments, helping landlords stay updated on transactions and promptly address any overdue payments.

- Custom Document Generation: MRE allows landlords to create custom documents for effective communication with tenants. Personalized letters, notices, and announcements can be generated to ensure clear and consistent correspondence.

```
? Do you want the database to be populated with? demonstration data
? Select your email delivery service? (required for password reset and tenant sign in) None
? Enter the URL to access the landlord front-end: http://localhost:8080/landlord
? Enter the URL to access the tenant front-end (it should share the same domain and port as the landlord front-end URL): http://localhost:8080/tenant
```

Once the application has started successfully, you will find several links displayed in the console to access the landlord and tenant applications.

Copy the link and paste into your preferred web browser to access the applications.
